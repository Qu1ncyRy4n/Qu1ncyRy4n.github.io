## Personal Statment

My name is Quincy Ryan. I am undergraduate transfer student studying cognitive science (computational emphasis) at UC Davis. I have 4 quarters left of course work, and am aiming to gain as much lab experience as possible. I'm hoping to establish career in neuroscience/computational research that is collaborative, intellectually rigorous, and in service of others.
